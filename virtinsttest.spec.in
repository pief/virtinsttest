%description
virtinsttest is a Python script that allows automated virtual testing
of automated OS installations.

The idea is that you throw your (unmodified) OS installation scripting
code (eg. AutoYast or, in the future, Kickstart code) plus a simple
virtinsttest-specific config file at it and it will do all the work
for you that you'd otherwise have to do manually:
- Creating virtual disk image files 
- Creating virtual USB sticks based on the contents of a directory
  (to simulate feeding the AutoYast/Kickstart code to the SUSE/RedHat
  installer in a no-network scenario)
- Defining a test VM instance
- Starting the VM and the OS installation
- Monitoring the installation for progress
- Running tests inside the installed system to determine
  installation success or failure (not implemented yet)

...effectively allowing you to use virtinsttest as part of a CI pipeline
to test changes to your OS installation scripting code automatically and
get rapid feedback.

virtinsttest uses guestfstools and, through libvirt, qemu and KVM. It
uses a plugin system to implement support for the OSes to be installed
(eg. watching installation progress).
